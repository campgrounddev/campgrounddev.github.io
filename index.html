								<!--<p class="content">We started our work with a simple mission: Connecting communications professionals to media contacts better than anyone else does. Campground is a small, self-funded team; we want to be the best in the industry at a few crucial things rather than "just OK" at many things, and nothing is more lacking in the PR software space right now than comprehensive solutions for finding the right media outreach targets quickly. On our own team, we estimate that Campground can reduce about 6 hours of work for an associate communication professional down to about 20 minutes. The marketing software industry sat at around $50 billion in 2020 (with a projected CAGR of 17.4%) and we estimate our media intelligence product can directly address the needs of 20% of that. Outside of the primary, we also see revenue paths via a paid API for businesses to use our natural language models, boutique PR consulting, and an expansion of the platform to cover more aspects of the PR space: Press release generation and distribution, automated email, SEO analytics, and customer relationship management.</p>

									<h2>The best lists anywhere</h2>
								</header>
								<p>We started our company with a simple mission: Connecting communications professionals to media contacts better than anyone else does. Campground is a small, self-funded team; we want to be the best in the industry at a few big things rather than "just OK" at many things, and there is no greater opportunity in the PR software space than creating comprehensive solutions for finding the right media outreach targets quickly. Based on user research and product testing, we estimate that Campground can massively scale team productivity and outreach quality, reducing about 6 hours of work for an associate communications professional down to 20-30 minutes.</p>

									<h2>The market opportunity</h2>
								</header>
								<p>The marketing software was benchmarked around $50 billion in 2020 (with a projected CAGR of 17.4%), and we estimate our media intelligence product can directly address 20% of the market. Outside of the primary media intelligence platform, we also see revenue paths via a paid API for businesses to use our natural language models, boutique PR consulting, and an expansion of the platform to cover more aspects of the digital public relations space, such as press release generation and distribution, automated email with tracking and metrics, SEO analytics, and customer relationship management.</p>
